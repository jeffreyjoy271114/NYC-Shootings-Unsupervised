# NYC-Shootings-Unsupervised
> The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can cluster shooting incidents in New York City based on relevant attributes such as occurrence date and time, location, demographic information of perpetrators and victims, and jurisdiction. By identifying clusters of similar incidents, law enforcement agencies can better understand the underlying dynamics of gun violence and tailor their interventions accordingly
